## "To create an inclusive open-source community that is fun to be a part of,
## exciting to innovate in, and rewarding to its members
## both professionally and personally."

### Inclusive
The Berry Battle community is open to anyone and everyone from all walks of life. From young aspiring developers to seasoned veterans and tech leads, everyone has something to offer in this community. We embrace people from diverse backgrounds and actively seek to include individuals with varied perspectives and experiences.

### Fun
The primary reason for the Berry Battle community to exist is to have fun. Working on the simulator infrastructure, creating a battler AI, setting up ad-hoc tournaments, or any other activity in this community should be enjoyable for all participants. 

### Innovative
Participation in the Berry Battle community should inspire ideas and creative thought. Solving tough problems and trying to anticipate the unknown challenges of the future are an integral part of what make this project fun.

### Rewarding
The Berry Battle community strives to give something back to the members that are so critical to the ecosystem. It is a place to learn new things, accomplish stretch goals, have fun with friends, and grow.
